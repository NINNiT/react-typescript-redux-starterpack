## Short description:

The Gamers Finest In House Selling Platform, is a small version of the inventory management / shopping function of cardmarket.

It is used to allow Customers to search for the cards they need, as well as allow them to place them into a shopping basket and afterwards checkout.

This leads to a order beeing able to be processed by a staff member, while having a sorted list and prices already in place, as well as not needing to care for the inventory. The inventory will be updated regularly to minimize the chance of desync between actual cardmarket offers and database information.
